(Ominious music plays in the background) There is no light in the room, only darkness. Tiny footsteps can be heard, followed by a frantic voice of an eight-year-old girl.

Alice: (Crying) Mommy! Daddy! Big Brother! Where are you? (Sniff, sniff)

The little girl walks around in the dark, and her foot lands on something. The object made an squishy sound under her foot. She lifts up her foot, and the lights randomly engulfed the room.

Alice: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Alice trembles and cries as she sees her dead family lying in the pool of blood. Blood had been splattered on the walls, and the bodies had been mutilated and mangled to the point where she couldn't distinguish which body belong to who. Their organs had been ripped out of their cavities, and the heart was unknownly demolished by her foot. An evil laugh followed in satisfaction of her wretched state and fades into emptiness.

Alice starts to hyperventilate, and darkness fills her vision as everything spins before her. The trauma is too much for her heart and brain. Her body slumps onto the floor while her conciousness fades into nothingness.

It had been 5 years after the the dreadful event. Alice is with a new family, and she believes them to be her biological family. As a matter of fact, her family has not told her the truth as they are afraid a mental breakdown might occur if they did, and Alice has no recollection of what had happened on that fateful day.

Alice, now thirteen, walks home from school with a book in her arms while humming a song. A slight ringing soud echoes in her ear, and Alice perks up and looks around for the source of the sound. She sees nothing, shrugs, and continues her walk through the forest. The ringing noise is back again. An alarmed Alice looks once more again, and a ball of light slowly materializes in front of her. She looks straight into the light, and her vision blurrs as she is under a trance. The ball of light moves off the path into the trees. Alice follows mindlessly the bright object and walks into the darkness of the forest as she drops the book.

Who knows how long has passed? Seconds, minutes, hours? Alice regains her vision, shakes her head, and takes in the view around her. This is not a familiar place to Alice, so the girl frantically looks for the way back. There is no visible path, but only trees surround the open field of grass.

An inhuman growl fills the forest as birds and squirrels leave the trees in fear. A black ooze emerges from the floor and soldifies into a two-headed dragon. Alice tries to run into the the trees. However, the trees recede from her as Alice has not travel a foot yet. She can't leave the area as there is a dark force controlling the landscape.  A look of horror is on her face as she has no way to escape, and fear is instilled in her legs.

Alice: I can't move!

Her mind and body are not working together. The heinous beast roars and charges with its jaw open. Alice screams and closes her eyes for impact. There was none, and she takes a peek. A scythe floats in front of her, making a shield, and the monsters screeches in pain and lurks back. She quickly grabs the scythe with unknown familiarity and positions herself for a long fight.

The final boss screeches and disintegrates. Alice takes a deep breath as memories start to flood through her mind.
